# Research Notes

## Abstract
Planetary nebulae represent a key stage in stellar evolution, yet their morphology and ionization
structure remain incompletely understood. The Ring Nebula (M57), one of the most famous
planetary nebulae, located in the constellation of Lyra at a distance of around 2,000 light-years
which makes it an ideal structure for detailed study about.
We propose to obtain imaging of M57, using the Celestron 14” Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with
the CCD camera and the use of B, V and R filters.
The data will allow us to study the dimensions and the ionization degree qualitatively.

## Brainstorm

- Tamanho da nébula
- Cores da nébula
- Grau de Ionização e estrutura
- Magnitude de Superficie e Magnitude aparente
- Temperatura em algumas regiões (temperature gradient)
- Spectral energy distribution (SED)
- Descrição morfológica
- White dwarf in the center
- Radiation
- Velocidade de Expansão (pesquisar)
- Brightness distribution 
- Evolutionary state → ionization structure and relative strengths of [O III] vs Hα can indicate the temperature and luminosity of the central star.
